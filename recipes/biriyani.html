            <p>Step 1 : <br> Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies

            To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). <br> Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Step 2 : <br> Saute the onions

                Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan.<br> Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. <br> 
                Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. <br> Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes.<br> Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish) </p>

            <p>Step 3 : <br> Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes

                Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. <br> Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender.<br> Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly.<br> Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it.<br> You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.</p>
