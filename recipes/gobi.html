    <h3>How to Prepare</h3>

        <li>
            <p>Step 1 : <br> Prepare the Cauliflower<br>

                Clean a medium-sized cauliflower head and separate it into bite-sized florets.<br>
                Wash the florets thoroughly and blanch them in boiling water for about 2-3 minutes to soften them slightly.<br>
                Drain the water and pat the florets dry using a kitchen towel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 2 : <br> Coat and Fry the Cauliflower<br>

                In a bowl, mix the blanched cauliflower florets with cornstarch or all-purpose flour until they are evenly coated. <br>You can add a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor.
                In a deep frying pan, heat oil over medium heat.<br> Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated cauliflower florets in small batches and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy.<br>
                Remove the fried cauliflower with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 3 : <br> Prepare the Manchurian Sauce<br>

                In a separate pan, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat.<br>
                Add finely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilies to the pan and saut√© for a minute until they become aromatic.<br>
                Pour in the Manchurian sauce (you can either use a store-bought one or make it from scratch using soy sauce, ketchup, vinegar, chili sauce, and other seasonings).<br>
                Stir the sauce well and let it simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Step 4 : <br>  Combine the Cauliflower and Sauce<br>

                Add the fried cauliflower florets to the pan with the Manchurian sauce.<br>
                Toss the florets gently in the sauce until they are evenly coated.<br>
                Cook for another minute or two, allowing the cauliflower to absorb the flavors of the sauce.<br>
                Garnish with chopped spring onions (green onions).
